          <p>
            Because a license key cannot be &ldquo;returned&rdquo;, revealed keys
            are generally non-refundable. The exception is a key that fails to
            activate and cannot be replaced — in that case we refund that line of
            the order.

          <h2 className="font-medium text-foreground">Faulty keys</h2>
          <p>
            Report activation problems within 30 days with the error message you
            see. We will first try to issue a replacement key, then refund if no
            replacement is available.

          <h2 className="font-medium text-foreground">How refunds are paid</h2>
          <p>
            Approved refunds go back to the original payment method, typically
            within 5–10 business days.
